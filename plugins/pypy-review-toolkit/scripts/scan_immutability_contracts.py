"""Detect immutability-contract mismatches -- the crown jewel.

A class declaring ``_immutable_fields_ = [...]`` (or ``@jit.elidable`` on a
function) makes a promise the JIT relies on to cache/reorder: the field
never changes after construction (or the function has no side effects and
its result depends only on its arguments). This scanner catches the
strictly-immutable case: a field listed WITHOUT PyPy's quasi-immutable
``?`` marker that the class body nonetheless reassigns outside ``__init__``.

**The one thing to get right first**: PyPy's quasi-immutable marker for a
list field is ``'closure?[*]'`` -- the ``?`` comes *before* ``[*]``, not
after. A marker check that only looks at the string's tail
(``raw.endswith('?')``) misses this and produces false positives on fields
that are already correctly marked. This was a real bug found during the
investigation behind this toolkit's design doc (§3.2) -- the corrected
parser lives in ``pypy_utils.classify_immutable_field`` and is tested
against this exact fixture in ``tests/test_pypy_utils.py``.

Every real candidate from the design doc's investigation (7 of 201 checked
classes, all individually traced) fell into one of two priority tiers:

  - Mid-lifetime reassignment on a still-live object (``PyCode.co_filename``
    frozen at translation time; ``GeneratorIterator.pycode`` reassigned in
    ``descr__setstate__``; ``CPPMethod.cif_descr`` lazily built and,
    critically, read right next to a ``jit.promote(self)`` call) -- the
    strongest evidence, since a live object being read by JIT-promoted code
    is exactly the scenario the immutability contract exists to protect.
  - Cleanup-time reassignment inside ``__del__`` (``W__StructInstance.rawmem``
    nulled on finalization) -- structurally different and lower priority,
    since a finalizing object generally isn't still being actively traced.

This scanner tiers findings the same way rather than treating every
mismatch as equally severe.
