"""Detect ``we_are_translated()`` arm divergence -- the flagship check.

``rpython.rlib.objectmodel.we_are_translated()`` branches PyPy's own source
between two execution modes: interpreted-under-CPython (the fast test-suite
path) and translated-to-C (the real interpreter). The two arms are, by
construction, never exercised by the same test run -- this has no analog in
CPython or RustPython, which is why it's this toolkit's flagship (design doc
§3.3), currently held as a working hypothesis rather than confirmed.

The census behind the design doc found 284 real branch sites (166 files) and
a split the original plan didn't anticipate: only 59 (21%) have an
``else``/``elif`` arm to diff. The remaining 225 (79%) are a bare
``if not we_are_translated(): assert ...`` -- every sampled instance was a
debug-only sanity check, not two behaviors to diff. That shape is
mechanically recognizable (body is only assert/raise statements) and is
suppressed here automatically -- an agent spending judgment on 225 sites a
run before this suppress rule existed would have drowned in noise for no
signal, exactly the outcome every census behind this toolkit's design
warned against.

Two-arm sites get a POLICY-vs-CONSIDER-vs-FIX classification based on how
different the two arms actually look, not a flat "has both arms" flag --
``rpython/rlib/rgil.py``'s ``EmulatedGilHolder`` shim (both arms call
different real implementations, both produce/consume real values) is
deliberate and substantial, not the same thing as a bare debug print, and
the classification here reflects that distinction rather than lumping every
two-arm site under one label.
