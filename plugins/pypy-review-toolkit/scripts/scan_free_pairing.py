"""Detect raw free()-pairing hazards and suspicious ffi attribute access in lib_pypy/.

Shape B + C from design doc §0.1/§9.3, danzin's confirmed bug #4:
`lib_pypy/_lzma.py`'s `LZMADecompressor` has two independent defects,
confirmed against the real source at `release-pypy3.11-v7.3.23`:

  (a) `post_decompress_avail_data` (line 562): after `m.free(self._input_buffer)`,
      assigns `self._input_buffer = ffi.NONE` -- **`ffi.NONE` does not exist**.
      The very next check, three lines later, is `if self._input_buffer is
      ffi.NULL:`, confirming `ffi.NULL` was intended. The typo means the
      assignment raises `AttributeError`, leaving `self._input_buffer`
      pointing at freed memory.
  (b) `clear_input_buffer` (line 574): an unlocked
      `if self._input_buffer is not ffi.NULL: m.free(...)` -- the class has
      `self.lock` and uses it elsewhere (`decompress()` at line 595 in the
      real source), but this entry point doesn't take it, so two threads can
      both pass the NULL check and both free.

**Deliberately narrow, per the design doc's honesty standard**: this is one
confirmed bug covering both sub-shapes at once, not two independently
confirmed instances the way `scan_unvalidated_helper_calls.py`'s two
helpers are -- output here is CONSIDER only, never escalated based on this
scanner's say-so alone. Scoped to `lib_pypy/` specifically (confirmed real
via `discover_pypy.py`'s new in-scope layer, §9.3) since that's where the
confirmed bug lives and where raw `free()` calls are rare enough to check
narrowly: only 4 files in the real checkout call `.free(` at all
(`_gdbm.py`, `_lzma.py`, `_overlapped.py`, `_pypy_util_cffi.py`).

Two checks:

1. **Suspicious `ffi.<name>` attribute access** -- flags any `ffi.X` where
   `X` isn't in a conservative allowlist of real cffi API members. Coarse
   (not a real resolution of cffi's actual API surface), but cheap and
   exactly targeted at the confirmed `ffi.NONE` typo shape.
2. **Unlocked `free()` after a `None`-is-not check, in a class that uses
   `self.lock` elsewhere** -- flags a `free()` call not textually inside a
   `with self.lock:`/`self.lock.acquire()` block, when the same class has a
   `self.lock` attribute and uses it in at least one other method. A class
   with no lock at all isn't flagged here (nothing to be inconsistent
   with) -- that's a different, unconfirmed concern this scanner doesn't
   claim to cover.

    (ffi.cdef, ffi.set_source, ffi.compile, ffi.callback, etc.) that simply
    weren't in the list. cffi's actual API surface is too large and variable
    to maintain as a static allowlist.

    The real bug's shape is much narrower: `ffi.NONE` is an ALL-CAPS name
    that looks like a constant, but the only real all-caps cffi constant in
    common use is `ffi.NULL`. Restricting to all-caps names eliminates the
    false positives (ffi.cdef is lowercase) while still catching the exact
