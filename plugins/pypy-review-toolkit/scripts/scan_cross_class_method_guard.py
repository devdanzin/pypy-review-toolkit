"""Detect a method missing the guard its same-named siblings on other classes have.

**Corrects a real design mistake, found by re-verifying against the correct
checkout.** `scan_sibling_guard_consistency.py` (built first) checks for a
guard missing *within one class*, using `self._check_*(...)` calls as the
guard signal. Re-verifying danzin's confirmed bug #5 against
`release-pypy3.11-v7.3.23` (the actual tag matching the fuzzing target --
`main`, used for every earlier scanner in this toolkit, turned out to be
tracking Python 2.7.18, not 3.11.15 at all) showed the real bug doesn't
match that shape:

- The guard is an inline `if self.w_raw:` / `if self.fd >= 0:` truthiness
  check, not a delegated `self._check_*(...)` call.
- The defect is **cross-class**, not within-class: `_dealloc_warn_w` is
  defined separately on 5 different classes across `pypy/module/_io/`
  (`W_IOBase` -- no-op stub, correctly unguarded; `W_BufferedReader`/etc via
  `interp_bufferedio.py`'s mixin -- guards `self.w_raw`;
  `interp_win32consoleio.py` -- guards `self.buf`; `interp_fileio.py` --
  guards `self.fd`/`self.closefd`; `interp_textio.py`'s
  `W_TextIOWrapper` -- **no guard at all**, calls
  `space.call_method(self.w_buffer, "_dealloc_warn", w_source)`
  unconditionally). Four of five same-named definitions guard their
  relevant field before use; one doesn't.

This scanner checks the real shape: collect every method definition across
all in-scope files, grouped by method name. For names with 2+ definitions
on different classes, flag any definition that accesses `self.<field>`
(a call or attribute access, not just a read) without a preceding
`if self.<field>` truthiness/None-check anywhere earlier in the same
function, when at least one same-named sibling definition does have such a
guard. A bare `pass`/stub definition (like `W_IOBase`'s) is not flagged --
it doesn't access any field at all, so there's nothing to guard.

`scan_sibling_guard_consistency.py` is kept as a separate, valid check --
it catches a related but genuinely different pattern (within-class
guard-convention deviation, confirmed real on `W_BytesIO`/`W_StringIO`/
`W_MemoryView`, none of which is the confirmed bug itself). This scanner
is the one that actually reproduces catching bug #5.
