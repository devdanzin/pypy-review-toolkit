"""Detect interp/app boundary leaks: raw exceptions where OperationError is expected.

``pypy/interpreter/gateway.py``'s ``unwrap_spec``/``interp2app`` wrap
interpreter-level (RPython) functions for calling from the Python program
PyPy is running. A raw Python exception (``raise ValueError(...)``) raised
in interp-level code reachable from app-level execution leaks CPython-hosted
exception machinery into what's supposed to be a faithfully emulated
app-level exception -- correct only by accident under CPython-hosted
testing, and not guaranteed to survive translation.

**Primary signal: same-function asymmetry, not a flat raise-site count.**
The investigation behind this toolkit's design doc found its strongest real
candidate this way -- ``pypy/interpreter/pyframe.py``'s
``initialize_frame_scopes`` has two structurally similar internal-
consistency checks a few lines apart: one correctly uses
``oefmt``/``OperationError``, the other raises a raw ``ValueError``. A flat
count of raw-exception sites (97 in the census, nearly as many as the 107
correct sites) doesn't discriminate well on its own; a function using both
conventions for similar checks is a much sharper signal, and it's checkable
statically -- no call-graph pass required.

**Secondary check: a lightweight caller-reachability search.** The
investigation resolved ``pypy/interpreter/argument.py``'s ``fixedunpack``
as a false positive -- a raw ``ValueError`` with a docstring that says
"raise a real ValueError," with zero production callers in the tree (the
only call site is its own test, which explicitly asserts the exception).
This scanner does the cheap version of that same check: a text search for
the function's name as a call (``.funcname(`` or bare ``funcname(``)
anywhere in non-test in-scope source. It's a heuristic, not real call-graph
analysis (it can't see conditional/reflective calls, and matches on name
alone rather than resolving which class the call is actually against) --
zero matches is treated as a real signal (ACCEPTABLE, matching what
happened with fixedunpack), but a nonzero count is not proof of reachability
either, just "worth a closer look," same CONSIDER posture as everything
else this scanner reports.
