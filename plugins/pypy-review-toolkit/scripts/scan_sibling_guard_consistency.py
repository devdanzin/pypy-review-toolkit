"""Detect app-exposed methods missing a class's established guard convention.

Shape D from design doc §9.1/§9.2, per danzin's fusil-confirmed bug #5:
`TextIOWrapper.detach()` followed by `._dealloc_warn(None)` segfaults.
pypy#5123's fix added a guard to the analogous method on the *buffered* IO
layer (`interp_bufferedio.py`) but never touched the *text* IO layer
(`interp_textio.py`) -- an incomplete fix applied to one layer of a wrapper
stack, leaving one method without the guard every sibling method on its
class has.

**Generalizes an idea already working elsewhere in this toolkit**:
`interp-app-boundary-checker`'s same-function-asymmetry signal (two checks
in one function, one correct convention and one not) proved to be the
strongest real signal that scanner found. This is the same idea one level
up -- N methods on a class, N-1 call the class's own `self._check_*(...)`
guard convention before doing their work, one doesn't.

**The distinguishing signal is `TypeDef`/`interp2app` registration, not
underscore-prefix naming.** A naive "does this method call a guard" check
run against a real class (`W_TextIOWrapper`) produces 9 false candidates
out of 34 methods -- but 8 of those 9 are purely internal RPython helper
methods (`_read_chunk`, `_ensure_data`, etc.) that are only ever called
*from* an already-guarded exposed method, and legitimately don't need their
own guard. The real distinguishing signal, confirmed against the actual
checkout, is whether a method is registered as `interp2app(ClassName.method)`
inside the class's `TypeDef(...)` -- i.e., actually reachable from running
app-level Python code. This scanner only evaluates methods in that set.

**v0.1 limitation, stated plainly**: "guard" is detected as any call to
`self._check_*(...)` -- a real, confirmed PyPy naming convention
(`_check_init`, `_check_attached`, `_check_closed` all exist in the real
checkout), but a class could plausibly use a differently-named guard
pattern this scanner won't recognize. A convention is only "established"
for a class when at least 2 of its exposed methods use it -- a single
guarded method isn't enough evidence the class has a real convention to
deviate from.
